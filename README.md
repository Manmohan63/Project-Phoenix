## Project-Phoenix
Inspired from CpUnofficial is a comprehensive platform for competitive programming competitions that was developed using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Firebase. It provides a wide variety of options for competitive programmers to use. Users can sign up, enter their Codeforces and LeetCode IDs, chat with other users, learn about upcoming competitions on the events page, view their profile information pulled from the Codeforces API, keep tabs on their submissions on both sites, edit their profile information, peruse a curated list of learning resources, and investigate a collection of browser extensions and tools necessary for competitive programming. CpUnofficial is built to be entirely responsive, meaning that it will look great on any size screen.

# Technologies Used
CPUnofficial utilizes the following technologies:

1. Next.js: A React framework for building server-rendered applications. Next.js provides server-side rendering, static site generation, and other powerful features that enhance performance and improve SEO.
2. Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid UI development. Tailwind CSS provides a set of pre-defined utility classes that can be combined to create custom and responsive designs.
3. Firebase: A comprehensive suite of cloud-based tools and services provided by Google. Firebase is used in CPUnofficial for user authentication, real-time database management, and hosting. It simplifies the development process and provides scalable and secure infrastructure for the platform.

These technologies were chosen for CpUnofficial due to their combination of flexibility, ease of use, and robustness. Next.js provides a solid foundation for building complex web applications, while Tailwind CSS streamlines the UI development process. Firebase offers a reliable backend infrastructure for user authentication and data storage, enabling secure and efficient operations within the platform.

By leveraging these technologies, CpUnofficial delivers a seamless and performant user experience for competitive programmers.
